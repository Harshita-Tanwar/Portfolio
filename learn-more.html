        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            Currently, I am pursuing my <b>B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence from IGDTUW, Delhi</b>, 
            where I have achieved a <b>CGPA of 9.13</b>. My college experience has allowed me to sharpen my technical skills while also fostering my 
            leadership abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before embarking on my college journey, I completed my schooling at Sadhu Vaswani International School for Girls (SVISG), where I was 
            a <b>black badge holder</b>. As a black badge holder, I <b>organized and managed various school events</b>, taking on the responsibility of overseeing 
            student activities and ensuring smooth coordination. I passsed my 12th CBSE Boards exam with <b>94%</b> and 10th CBSE board exams with a

        <p>
            This passion for leadership naturally carried over to my college life, where I proudly serve as the Class Representative (CR) of my batch. 
            In this role, I handle over 70 students, acting as a bridge between students and faculty. My aim is to ensure effective communication 
            and to address any concerns or queries efficiently, making the learning environment smoother for everyone.
